# Overview 
## Game Engine 
I created this game mainly in Javascript. Users will control a fish as it tries to avoid obstacles and swims from the artic ocean to the nearest continent. Users will be able to save their progress, and eventually "win" by traversing thousands of virtual miles underwater.

## Logic
* check for collisions between fish and other objects
* take in user input to update fish location
* update fish location and re-render on the screen
* play sounds on special eevnts
